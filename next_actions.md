## Next Actions: Write README - Quick Setup Instructions

1. Create the README.md file with the following sections:

   a. Project Overview
      - Brief description of the MCP Communication Project
      - Explanation of the three main components (MCP Server, App A, App B)
      - Description of the Fast MCP style implementation

   b. Prerequisites
      - Python requirements
      - API keys needed (OpenAI and Anthropic)
      - Port availability (9001, 8000, 8001)

   c. Installation
      ```bash
      # Install required dependencies
      pip install fastapi uvicorn requests
      ```

   d. Configuration
      - Instructions to set up API keys in:
         * app_a/llm_client.py (OpenAI key)
         * app_b/llm_client.py (Anthropic key)

   e. Running the Services
      ```bash
      # Terminal 1: Start MCP Server
      cd mcp_server
      uvicorn app:app --port=9001

      # Terminal 2: Start App A
      cd app_a
      uvicorn app:app --port=8000

      # Terminal 3: Start App B
      cd app_b
      uvicorn app:app --port=8001
      ```

   f. Testing the Setup
      ```bash
      # Send a test email to App A
      curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/summarize" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"email":"Hello, I need help with my laptop refund."}'

      # Check App B's response
      curl -X POST "http://localhost:8001/poll"
      ```

   g. Project Structure
      - Directory layout explanation
      - Purpose of each file
      - Flow diagram of how the components interact

2. Format and Style
   - Use Markdown formatting for better readability
   - Include code blocks with proper syntax highlighting
   - Add section headers and bullet points for clear organization

3. Review and Testing
   - Verify all commands work as documented
   - Check that the installation steps are complete
   - Ensure API key setup instructions are clear
   - Validate all endpoints and example requests
