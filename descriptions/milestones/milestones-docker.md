# MCP Dockerization Milestones

## Overview
This document outlines the milestones for containerizing the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server using Docker. The goal is to create a modular microservice architecture where the MCP server and its components can be deployed and scaled independently.

## Milestone 1: Environment Setup and Docker Configuration
- [ ] Install Docker and Docker Compose if not already available
- [ ] Create a basic Dockerfile for the MCP server
- [ ] Set up a .dockerignore file to exclude unnecessary files
- [ ] Create a basic docker-compose.yml file for local development
- [ ] Document Docker setup requirements

## Milestone 2: MCP Server Containerization
- [ ] Refactor MCP server code for containerization if needed
- [ ] Configure environment variables for Docker environment
- [ ] Create Docker network configuration for inter-service communication
- [ ] Build and test MCP server Docker image
- [ ] Implement health checks for the MCP server container
- [ ] Document MCP server container usage and configuration options

## Milestone 3: Database and State Management
- [ ] Determine state persistence strategy (volume mounts, external database, etc.)
- [ ] Configure data volumes for persistent storage if needed
- [ ] Implement connection pooling for database access if applicable
- [ ] Test data persistence across container restarts
- [ ] Document data management procedures

## Milestone 4: WebSocket and API Configuration
- [ ] Configure WebSocket endpoints for container environment
- [ ] Update CORS settings for containerized environment
- [ ] Test WebSocket connections from external clients
- [ ] Ensure proper routing between frontend and containerized backend
- [ ] Document API endpoints and WebSocket configuration

## Milestone 5: Integration with Frontend
- [ ] Update frontend configuration to connect to containerized MCP server
- [ ] Test frontend-to-container communication
- [ ] Implement environment-specific configuration for development/production
- [ ] Document frontend integration steps

## Milestone 6: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Create automated tests for containerized environment
- [ ] Perform load testing on containerized services
- [ ] Validate all functionality works as expected in containers
- [ ] Document testing procedures and results

## Milestone 7: Deployment Pipeline
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for building and deploying Docker images
- [ ] Configure container registry for image storage
- [ ] Implement versioning strategy for Docker images
- [ ] Create deployment scripts for various environments
- [ ] Document deployment procedures

## Milestone 8: Monitoring and Logging
- [ ] Implement logging solution for containerized services
- [ ] Set up monitoring for container health and performance
- [ ] Configure alerting for container issues
- [ ] Document monitoring and logging procedures

## Milestone 9: Documentation and Knowledge Transfer
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation for Docker setup
- [ ] Document container architecture and design decisions
- [ ] Provide troubleshooting guides for common issues
- [ ] Create runbooks for operations team

## Future Work: Additional Service Containerization
- [ ] Plan containerization strategy for app_a, app_b, etc.
- [ ] Design inter-service communication patterns
- [ ] Prepare for service discovery implementation
- [ ] Outline scaling strategy for multiple containerized services
